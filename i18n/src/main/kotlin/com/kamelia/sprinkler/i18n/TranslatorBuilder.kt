/**
 * Builder class used to create a [Translator]. This class provides several methods to add data to the translator from
 * different sources.
 *
 * There are several points of attention to take into account when using this class:
 * - The order in which data is added is significant, as it will be used during key duplication resolution, depending on
 * the [DuplicatedKeyResolution] used.
 * - Values passed to this builder are all validated on building, to ensure that the potential variables used in the
 * string respect the [TranslationInterpolationVariable] rules. If a value does not respect these rules, an exception
 * will be thrown when adding the value to the builder.
 *
 * The translators created with this builder will have the following properties:
 * - the created translators are immutable and therefore `thread-safe`.
 * - all methods returning a translator (e.g. [section][Translator.section],
 * [withNewCurrentLocale][Translator.withNewCurrentLocale]) returns a translator sharing common information with the
 * translator which created it. The methods do not copy the data, meaning that they do not have a significant
 * performance nor memory impact.
 * - the `extraArgs` argument passed to the [t][Translator.t] methods will be used to
 * [interpolate][com.kamelia.sprinkler.util.interpolate] the translation, all keys in the map will be replaced by their
 * corresponding values in the translation, except for the [Options.OPTIONS] key, which will contain a map of options as
 * defined in the [Options] class.
 * - the [Translator.t] method will behave according to the [TranslatorConfiguration.missingKeyPolicy] chosen when
 * creating the translator, in case the key is not found.
 * - the returned map of [Translator.toMap] will be sorted according to the lexical order of the
 * [key parts][Identifier] of the keys (the map is created every time the method is called).
 * - [toString] will use [toMap] under the hood to create the string representation of the translator.
 * - To be interpolated on [t][Translator.t] method call, values stored in the translator must contain variable defined
 * inside [delimiters][TranslatorConfiguration.Builder.interpolationDelimiter] defined in the translator configuration. For more
 * details about interpolation, see [String.interpolate][com.kamelia.sprinkler.util.interpolate]. Variables' names must
 * follow a specific format, which is defined in the [TranslationInterpolationVariable] typealias documentation.
